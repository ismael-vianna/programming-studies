## Project GPS Style
This app was an idea to develop in a classroom. It is a study case to teach about arrays and matrix on c++.
Use only the file "proj_gps_style.cc". On this project you need to know previously about loops, methods, global variable, matrix and array. Language used is C++.

### Exercise: 
We have 2 points A (origin) and B(destiny). Both has coordinates X and Y. You need trace a route from A to B. But you need contour a hole if you find it throw walking from A to B. This hole needs to be a point with coordinates X and Y.
After trace the rote with the contourning the hole print the points A,B and Hole. Print the route too.

Compile like this:
/> g++ YourFile.cpp -o YourExecutableFile
