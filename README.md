Repository of some cases when I help someone or exercises developed for class room.

## Project GPS Style
Use only the file "proj_gps_style.cc". On this project you need to know previously about loops, methods, global variable, matrix and array. Language used is C++.

After trace the rote with the contourning the hole print the points A,B and Hole. Print the route too.
