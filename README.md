# Programming Studies
Repository of some cases when I help someone or exercises developed for class room.

## Project GPS Style
Use only the file "proj_gps_style.cc". On this project you need to know previously about loops, methods, global variable, matrix and array. Language used is C++.

### Exercise: 
We have 2 points A (origin) and B(destiny). Both has coordinates X and Y. You need trace a route from A to B. But you need contour a hole if you find it throw walking from A to B. This hole needs to be a point with coordinates X and Y.
After trace the rote with the contourning the hole print the points A,B and Hole. Print the route too.

## Project Tic Tac Toe With ESP32
This project is a study of bluetooth connection between Android Phone and ESP32. The focus is send and receive messages throw bluetooth.
For this reason the game Tic Tac Toe was choosen for this study.
A Android Phone is used as a client and the ESP32 as a server. The client just play the game, and wait the server returning a message saying who wins and request a game restart. The server play the game together with the client.

This project is a part of teaches Distributed Systems class of UERGS.

You can find the part of Android Phone Project on App Inventor:

The project part applied for ESP32 was developed with Arduino IDE. You can find this file on directory "Project-Tic-Tac-Toe-With-ESP32".
